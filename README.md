# AuthCore
AuthCore is a client–server authorization and licensing core designed to protect applications from unauthorized use, response tampering, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  The project implements a multi-layer security model that combines TLS Certificate Pinning with Ed25519 cryptographic signatures, making proxy-based attacks, fake servers.
